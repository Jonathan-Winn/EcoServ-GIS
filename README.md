# EcoServ-GIS
EcoServ-GIS - an ecosystem services mapping toolkit based on ArcGIS ModelBuilder, ArcPy and Python Toolboxes

EcoServ-GIS has been developed using ArcGIS and ModelBuilder for use with ArcGIS 10.2.2 and Spatial Analyst.
The toolkit can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_v9QO2jyC4eNlVUbzY1UUstZU0&usp=sharing

The toolkit is designed for use in England, Scotland or Wales.

The purpose of this repository is to hold an example development of the toolkit using ArcPy within Python Toolboxes (rather than ModelBuilder), and potentialy with further developement of Python only versions (e.g. to work in situations without access to ArcGIS).
